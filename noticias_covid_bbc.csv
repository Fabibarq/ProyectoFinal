A 200-year-old landmark shut since the Covid pandemic is set to reopen in Edinburgh next month.
The Nelson Monument on Calton Hill closed to visitors during the lockdown in 2020 when structural issues were uncovered.
The tower, which has stood in the area since the early 19th Century, features a museum dedicated to Admiral Lord Horatio Nelson and the Battle of Trafalgar.
Plans to reinstate the monument's ""time ball"" synced to the firing of the one o'clock gun at Edinburgh Castle are hoped to be completed later in the year.

The 32-metre (150ft) high monument will welcome visitors over the summer months before closing again later in the year while the remainder of the work is carried out.
Scaffolding has been erected around the parapet at the top of the tower in preparation for a new mast being built.
When it reopens, visitors will be able to take in views of the city from a public deck, as well as visit the museum.
City of Edinburgh Council's culture and communities convener, councillor Val Walker, said she was ""excited"" to see the landmark reopen.

""We have been looking into replacing the mast on top of the monument and full refurbishment of the time ball, both of which have required working with specialist teams and a large capital investment,"" she told the Local Democracy Reporting Service.
""We’re looking to reopen the monument from May this year. It will operate for the summer months while a new mast is built and the time ball mechanism fully refurbished and a new automated system created.
“The monument will then close again around late September for the installation of the refurbished time ball and new mast. 
""Installation will take some three weeks however this will be weather-dependent so exact timings may change.""
Construction of the monument was completed in about 1816 to commemorate Nelson's victory at Trafalgar in 1805.
The time ball - which sits on top of the tower - was not added until 1853 as a time signal to ships in Leith and the Firth of Forth.
It would be raised shortly before 13:00 and lowered exactly on the hour via an underground wire connected to the city's observatory.
However, in 1861, the one o'clock gun was added at Edinburgh Castle in order to provide an audible sign in the event of fog or poor weather obscuring the ball to those at sea.
The ball was damaged in a storm in 2007, before being removed altogether for restoration in 2009.
It was returned a few months later and will be automated when current restoration work is complete.

,Resumen no encontrado,"Alan Wilkins, 71, is classed as having a weakened immune system
A man who was diagnosed with cancer twice and left with a weakened immune system was among the first to receive the Covid-19 booster jab this year.
About 413,000 people, who are either aged 75 and over or immunosuppressed, are now eligible for their next dose in north-east England and north Cumbria.
Alan Wilkins, 71, from County Durham, was invited to come forward for the top-up dose and said he was ""doing his bit"".
But fewer people were being offered the jab on the NHS because the spring programme was aimed at those most at risk, health bosses told the BBC.
Those eligible for the jab will be contacted by their doctor or GP surgery in the next few weeks to book an appointment. They have until 30 June to receive their vaccine.
People not included in the programme must pay for the jab, at up to £98.95 per dose.
Health boss Catherine Monaghan says Covid-19 can still be a serious illness 
Dr Catherine Monaghan, medical director at NHS North East and North Cumbria Integrated Health Board (ICB), said Covid-19 could still be a ""serious illness"" for some.
She said: ""We're really targeting the vaccine against the people likely to become seriously unwell or die from Covid.
""From all the data and all the experience we've got, we understand which patient groups and populations are more likely to become unwell.""
Latest figures showed there were 103 people being treated for Covid-19 in hospitals in the region, as of last week.
Mr Wilkins had his booster jab at a Boots branch in Durham city centre.
""I think that it protects you and that's what it's all about,"" he said.
Pamela Liddle was also among one of the first at the site to receive the booster, and added she was ""all for"" anything ""to help keep us safe"".
Emma Morris, healthcare partnership manager at Boots, added that the site had been ""busy"" and that clinics were ""fully booked and for the next ten days"".
Pamela Liddle was one of those eligible for a Covid-19 booster jab
The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), which advises the government, previously warned the programme would be ""smaller"" than previous years. 
Covid-19 was a ""relatively mild disease” for the majority of people, and the committee was required to assess the cost-effectiveness of all vaccination programmes, a JCVI spokesperson said.

,Resumen no encontrado,"The spring booster will be available to those most at risk of serious illness from Covid-19
Walk-in appointments will be available for those most at risk of serious illness from Covid-19 this spring, as they are urged to have a booster vaccine. 
From Monday, walk-in vaccinations will be available at community clinics for eligible residents in Bristol, North Somerset and South Gloucestershire (BNSSG).
Appointments can also be made at local pharmacies and GP clinics.
Dr Geeta Iyer, clinical lead for the BNSSG Covid-19 vaccination programme, said for clinically vulnerable and older people the virus ""can still be very dangerous and even life-threatening"".
UK vaccine experts say the booster should be available to everyone over 75, care-home residents and those aged six months and over who have a weakened immune system.
Dr Iyer said protection from Covid-19 can ""fade over time"" therefore it was important for people to take up the booster vaccine if they are eligible. 
She said: ""It’s quick and easy to recharge your immunity and will give you the protection you need for the months ahead.""
""The vaccine has saved countless lives, prevented thousands from needing to go to hospital and helped us to live with the virus without fear or restrictions,"" she added.
The NHS said those invited should have the jab at least three months after their last dose.
The spring booster vaccine in BNSSG will be available until 30 June.
